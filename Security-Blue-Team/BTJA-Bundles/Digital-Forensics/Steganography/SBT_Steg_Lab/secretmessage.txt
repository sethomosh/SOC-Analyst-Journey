Ingredients

For the filling

    575g Bramley apple
    Bramley apples

    (3 medium apples), peeled, cored and sliced to 1 cm thick (see tip)
    2 tbsp golden caster sugar

For the crumble

    175g plain flour
    110g golden caster sugar
    110g cold butter
    Butter

For the topping (optional)

    1 tbsp rolled oats
    Two piles of oats

    1 tbsp demerara sugar
    double cream, clotted cream or custard, to serve

Method

    Heat the oven to 190C/170 fan/gas 5.

    Toss 575g peeled, cored and sliced Bramley apples with 2 tbsp golden caster sugar and put in a 23cm round baking dish at least 5cm deep, or a 20cm square dish. Flatten down with your hand to prevent too much crumble falling through.

    Put 175g plain flour and 110g golden caster sugar in a bowl with a good pinch of salt.

    Slice in 110g cold butter and rub it in with your fingertips until the mixture looks like moist breadcrumbs. Shake the bowl and any big bits will come to the surface – rub them in. Alternatively, pulse in a processor until sandy (don’t over-process).

    Pour the crumb mix over the apples to form a pile in the centre, then use a fork to even out.

    Gently press the surface with the back of the fork so the crumble holds together and goes crisp, then lightly drag the fork over the top for a decorative finish.

    Sprinkle 1 tbsp rolled oats and 1 tbsp demerara sugar over evenly, if you wish.

    Set on a baking tray and put in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, until the top is golden and the apples feel very soft when you insert a small, sharp knife. Leave to cool for 10 minutes before serving.

    Recipe Tip
    Apple varieties
    You can use other apples, rather than Bramley, for this recipe, but if you do, slice them thinly so they soften during baking, and test carefully with a knife before removing from oven.
    Recipe Tip
    Peeling apples
    If you do this with a knife rather than a peeler, it is easier to cut them into quarters first. Alternatively, for a more rustic effect, leave the apples unpeeled.
    Recipe Tip
    Make it your own
    If you make apple crumble all the time, you may feel like varying it.- Mix 1/2tsp mixed spice, cinnamon or allspice, or the scraped seeds of half a vanilla pod, into the sugar when tossing apples- Add a handful of blackberries to the apples

Really simple and easy recipe that turns out so delicious. I added ginger and cinnamon to the crumble and apples and I thought this gave it a nice bit of extra flavour.

This was brilliant! I used a mix of dark brown and caster sugar instead of golden and used apples, plums and blackberries! It was crunchy and delicious! I definitely will make this again. It was finished as soon as I put it on the table.

I added 20g more of the flour and butter but kept the sugar at 110g and didn't press the crumble down, just spread it lightly with a fork. Turned out well.

As an apple crumble enthusiast, I was immensely let down by this recipe. My crumble was to thick and therefore impossible to eat. I left it in for the recommended 40 mins and when my dearest crumble came out of my 4d hot air oven it was as hard as a rock! When I cut into my glorious apple crumble I discovered that the apple and the crumble weren’t even connected! The quality of my apple crumbles are usual deviné but this disgraceful excuse for an apple crumble really upsets me. I hope my fellow apple crumble enthusiasts will take this as a warning. Beware this apple crumble recipe beware. Sincerely- Applecrumblelover

Two things wrong with this recipe. 1 do not press down or fork the topping this encourages the mix to solidify. Just spoon in heaps all over and don't touch you will get a delightful crumbly topping. 2 Do not add oats. For the very best crumble check out Simon Hopkinson's Rhubarb crumble from his book and TV show "The good cook" use whatever fruit you like. Trust me you will not find a better recipe anywhere.
